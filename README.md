# TECH 104 Project
Choose a system that has a computer program that your are familiar with or will become familiar with by being the first to choose it on the Blackboard Discussion forum.

As the semester progresses we will use C programming features that we learn in class to make our respective projects more like the real life systems. We will work only on the computer program, we will not be building any physical parts of the system this semester. 

### Labs
0. Compiling/running first program (command prompt, gcc pun.c from textbook)
1. Project choice
2. Input, preprocessor statements
3. Calculation with datatypes, formatted output
4. Conditional statements
5. Functions
6. Loop menu
7. Array
8. 2D array
9. String manipulation
10. Does your program mimic a device?

### Project Examples include:
1. The [Calculator Project](https://www.onlinegdb.com/Rjh8qgKKV) demonstrates:
2. Input, preprocessor statements: scanf, include
3. Calculation with datatypes, formatted output: integer, float, printf
4. Conditional statements: if/else, switch/case
5. Functions: no
6. Loop menu: for loop
7. Array: no
8. 2D array: no
9. String manipulation: no
10. Does your program mimic a device?

And:

1. The example of Converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius on pages 24-25 of the textbook demonstrates:
2. Input, preprocessor statements: scanf, include, symbolic macro constant definition
3. Calculation with datatypes, formatted output: float, printf
4. Conditional statements: no
5. Functions: no
6. Loop menu: no
7. Array: no
8. 2D array: no
9. String manipulation: no
10. Does your program mimic a device?
