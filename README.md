# TECH 104 Project
Choose a system that has a computer program that your are familiar with or will become familiar with by being the first to choose it on this Blackboard Discussion forum.

As the semester progresses we will use C programming features that we learn in class to make our respective projects more like the real life systems. We will work only on the computer program, we will not be building any physical parts of the system this semester.

It demonstrates:
1. Preprocessor statements: include
2. Input/output: printf, scanf
3. Datatypes: integer, float
4. Loops: for loop
5. Conditional statements: if/else, switch/case
6. String manipulation: no
7. Arrays: no


On pages 24-25 of the textbook there is an example of Converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
It demonstrates:
1. Preprocessor statements: include, symbolic macro constant definition
2. Input/output: printf, scanf
3. Datatypes: float
4. Loops: no
5. Conditional statements: no
6. String manipulation: no
7. Arrays: no
