# TECH 104 Project
Choose a system that has a computer program that your are familiar with or will become familiar with by being the first to choose it on this Blackboard Discussion forum.

As the semester progresses we will use C programming features that we learn in class to make our respective projects more like the real life systems. We will work only on the computer program, we will not be building any physical parts of the system this semester.
