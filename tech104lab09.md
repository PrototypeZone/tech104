# TECH 104 Lab 09
- [ ] Present, compiles, comments, input, symbolic replacement macro constant, calculation, formatted output, menu of (4 options)+exit+invalid, loop, functions incl. DisplayHeader, use of a 2D array.   
- [ ] Use of Allman style as per p.91 of textbook. ([Reference document](https://humberital-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/mdrk0011_humber_ca/Ee6iBqaMJXtFih6kvjZc_7wBI6vaY4SiIN5vI1bv3Pgc0A?e=u313bQ)).

- [ ] Demonstrated functionality in the lab.
- [ ] Program logic updated to mimic an actual device.

0.  For the Fall 2023 semester we continued using ```apollo.humber.ca```   
1.  Demonstrate you program to your professor.
2.  Finish updating your program logic to mimic an actual device, each project is different. For example:
    ```c
	/** @brief Example for tech 104 lab08
	 *  @file energykiosk.c 
	 */
	 
	/** Preprocessor statements
     */
	// Actual preprocessor statements

	/** Functions */
	// Actual function code such as for the programming mode.
	
	/** Main Function 
	 *  Actual code that implements the logic to follow comments
	 */
	// When you arrive at a vehicle energy kiosk it welcomes you to the brand and asks you how you would like to pay.
	// There is likely a method with which to enter programming mode to be able to update things such as the cost of each unit of each type of energy.
	// If the programming mode is not entered, it prompts you to identify your possible affinity via a points card or air miles number or the like.
	// It then may or may not ask about vehicle cleaning or other services.
	// It might ask for payment authentication if this has yet to be resolved, and negotiate amount.
	// It provides a range of choices such as regular, premium, diesel, charge.
	// It directs you to make the connection and commence transfer
	// It will likely control the rate of transfer, ending it upon reaching agreed upon amount or other criteria.
	// It will likely direct disconnection and provide transaction details.
	// After a timeout it will likely revert to welcoming the next customer to the brand.
	```
	
3.  Ensure your program compiles by tomorrow morning at 10 am.
