• A passing grade for this course is 50%. To get an overall passing grade in
this course, students must independently pass the Reporting and the Project
Demonstration portions of the course. If one or more of these sections is less
than 50% then the final grade for the course will be the lower of the two marks.

• Late Submission penalty: 10% penalty per day for late submissions.

• Classroom attendance is mandatory for grading, the student will get zero for
the submission if they missed the session for the corresponding week.
