Welcome Letter
==============

Welcome to this CENG course. I am your professor and my role is to work with you
to ensure an effective, engaging and interactive learning experience. Before we
begin, I strongly encourage you to go through all of the information in this
letter. It clarifies many of the expectations around the successful completion
of this course.

My Role as Professor
--------------------

My role is to support you in your learning by:

-   Answering your questions about Course Content, Assignments, Tests and
    Quizzes.

-   Sharing with you my academic and professional experiences.

-   Providing real-life examples to help ground course theory.

-   Creating opportunities for you to interact with your classmates and
    encouraging you to participate in our online community.

-   Grading your assignments, tests and quizzes.

Help with Course Content
------------------------

Please use the **Discussion Board** tool in the left navigation pane to post
content related and non-course related questions outside of class time. This
way, your classmates have an opportunity to answer your questions and to see the
answers that are posted. There are pre-loaded Discussion Board forums that
students can use to post their queries.

At any time, you may send me an internal Blackboard message, using the **Course
Messages** tool, with comments, questions, and concerns. I will do my best to
get back to you as soon as possible (within 48 hours, perhaps longer on
weekends). Please check your Blackboard site frequently/daily for new messages
from your professor.
